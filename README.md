## Audio Processing Improvements

### Memory-Efficient Audio Processing

The app now includes memory-optimized audio processing to handle large files without Out of Memory (OOM) errors:

1. **Streaming WAV Decoder**: Processes audio files in chunks instead of loading entire files into memory
2. **Overlapping Chunk Transcription**: Splits long audio files into manageable chunks with overlap for seamless transcription
3. **Configurable Chunk Sizes**: Adjustable chunk sizes based on device memory and performance requirements

### Chunking Configuration

The transcription process uses configurable parameters:

- **Default Chunk Size**: 30 seconds per chunk
- **Overlap Size**: 3 seconds overlap between chunks
- **Maximum Chunk Size**: 60 seconds (configurable)
- **Memory Buffer**: 1MB processing chunks

### Benefits

- **No More OOM Errors**: Large audio files (hours long) can be processed without memory issues
- **Better Performance**: Smaller chunks process faster and use less memory
- **Seamless Transcription**: Overlapping chunks ensure no text is lost at chunk boundaries
- **Progressive Processing**: Real-time progress updates as chunks are processed

## Speech Recognition Technology

- **OpenAI Whisper** - State-of-the-art open-source automatic speech recognition
  - Robust multilingual speech recognition with support for over 50 languages
  - Trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervised data
  - Excellent performance across diverse audio conditions and accents
  - Can run locally without internet dependency once model is downloaded

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility** - Designed for versatile deployment
  - Consistent speech recognition quality across different operating systems
  - Flexible model sizes from tiny (39 MB) to large (1550 MB) based on accuracy needs
  - Advanced noise robustness and speaker independence
  - Perfect for applications requiring high-quality transcription in various environments
